# Non-Free Timer (nftimer)
As a joke as it may seem: if you, as a individual, are using a timer like this. Well... We are not free, people (not as free as this free-as-in-freedom-copylefted software, yay)!

This project is a fork of TimeCase. It is (or will be) my re-learning project, as I was a PHP developer some years ago. I pretend to update and modernize this project with a nicer frontend, more update libraries and PHP version etc. So, some ideas to keep track:

- Update to the latest (and safest) PHP version, considering even replacing libraries if needed;
- Modernized UI using Svelte (without runes cause I'm a noob);
- Translations (cause a lot of people like me ain't english native speakers)!
- Maybe... Debian and Arch/AUR packages, to facilitate the setup in Linux servers?

Below follows the original TimeCase readme.

TimeCase is a free, open-source, self-hosted, time tracking web application.

- Keep track of your time with accuracy and precision. Use the same web app on your desktop, tablet or phone.
- Allow your customers to login and analyze time spent on their projects and view reports.
- You can assign different roles to different users and pick team managers.
- View and analyze reports in real-time with flexible filters. Export data as csv file or display them as printable html.

# Using TimeCase

Some options will not be available for all access levels - for more information about access levels please read the next chapter.

## Time tracking
Track your time either by manually selecting time span or by auto-tracking. Auto-tracking is done vie the start/stop button. When start button is pressed time will start to flow and after you click on stop timer button dialog will appear and you can save this entry. On this screen you can also select default project and default work type so you don't have to select this every time. By clicking on existing time entry you can edit this record. 

## Statuses
All customers and projects records have a status field. There are three default statuses - important, active and closed. All records will be sorted by status so important will go first. If record has closed status, then this record will not show on drop-down menus except on reports. This gives you ability to archive old customer/project records and make drop-down selections smaller and faster. You can add additional statuses but you cannot change basic three types.  

## Account settings
All users except customers have ability to change their personal account settings like full name, email, password and details.

# AccessLevels
TimeCase has five different access levels:
 

### Administrator
Administrator can perform all actions: track and manage tracked time, manage customers, projects, users, work types, statuses and see reports.

### Manager
